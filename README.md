# SimScript Sample in React

This sample shows how you can use **SimScript** in a React application.

The sample defines a generic **SimulationComponent** that can be used to 
render any **SimScript** simulation. 

You can extend from **SimulationComponent** to create components that 
render simulations with custom handling for simulation parameters,
custom output, and animations.

[Run the sample](https://bernardo-castilho.github.io/simscript/react/).
