# SimScript Sample in React

This sample shows how you can use **SimScript** in a React application.

The sample defines a generic **SimulationComponent** that can be used to render
any **SimScript** simulation. 

It also shows how you can extend from **SimulationComponent** to create
components that show simulations with custom handling for simulation 
parameters and custom output.
